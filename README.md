# HyBioSum
Official implementation of HyBioSum, a hybrid method for biomedical long-document summarization. It combines supervised Longformer-based extractive summarization with zero-shot LLM-based abstractive summarization, and includes training scripts, evaluation, and inference. The method has been evaluated on the PubMed and CORD-19 datasets.
